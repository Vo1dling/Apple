First things first i starts working my way down the sections one by one checking their width and height to the tiniest difference and so i started with making a grid div to sort all of the different sections and items into it and then i started with the navbar

//Navbar//
The Navigation didn't take long seeing as now i'm used to making Navigation Bars the only obstacle was the search icon the issue was that it had 2 icons in it's frame for some reason one gray and the other white had to copy the original svg and delete the gray icon's path that solved the issue.(25 Minutes)

//Holiday Sale//
This Section didn't take that long as well beacuse the logo was easily to align seeing as the value needed to align it was a whole number and not a decimal number it was a bit harder to align the 3 images but it worked out well in the end.(35 Minutes)

//Section 1//
The Thing That took the most time in this section was getting the text into the image i made a mistake and assigned as a normal image at first then changed it to a background image also getting the text just right was also difficult.(50 Minutes)

//Section 2//
This Section Was alot easier since i used the first section as a complete template and changed the assets and values around as much as needed to get it working.(15 Minutes)

//Gallery//
the toughest thing in the gallery was getting the logos for the watch and other 3 items into their right place and at one point i had to adjust each one individually
and getting the orange "new" on top of the watch logo was pretty annoying not gonna lie also i couldnt find the start button icon for the 6th item the tv+ series so i had to use an icon from font awesome other than that the grid was pretty easy to set up using area templates.(1 Hour)

//Footer//
The footer took alot of time to get right from the right font/font size , right margins and width and height for each of the 3 divs "Footer" "Legal Explaination" and "Legal Links" also i had made a mistake early on with specificity assigning a value that overrode everything else which meant i had to rewrite some of my code to fix the issue.(2 Hours)
